*** output redirection ***

-> out is created and main.c is sent to out. No input goes to grep
cat main.c > out | grep codam

-> out and out1 are both created. main.c is sent to out
cat main.c > out | > out1

-> multiple output files: out, out1 & out2 are created; main.c gets directed to out2; echo hello is executed
cat main.c > out > out1 > out2 | echo hello

-> multiple output files: out, out1 & out2 are created; main.c gets directed to out2. BUT cat does not keep on waiting
cat main.c > out > out1 > out2 | cat

--> however, if it's not a pipe but a ; cat is a fresh command and will wait for input
cat main.c > out > out1 > out2 ; cat

*** input redirection ***
-> if int does not exist, it will say no file or directory
-> if int exist, cat main.c will be executed. < int will be disregarded 
cat main.c < int

-> if int does not exist, error message
-> if int exist, this command does not do anything. cat main.c goes into the pipe, however, it is not used by < int following the pipe
cat main.c | < int

-> if any input file does not exist, error messsagev
-> if all files exist, cat will display info from int3 (the last input file)
cat <int1 <int2 < int3

*** only input or output redirection ***
[regardless of the content, out file will be truncated to 0]
> out

[will create the file or leave the original file intact]
>> out

[if file does not exist, it will say no such file or redirectory]
< int

[if file exist, it will do nothing with the input]
< int
